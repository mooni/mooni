*This project is in early stage and shall be used with care.*

### Use cases
- I am a end user and I want to withdraw some crypto on my bank account
- I am a dApp developer and I want to allow my users to withdraw funds to their bank account (such as decentralized marketplaces, via a widget or iFrame)
- I have a DAO (Aragon) and I want to be able to pay a bill in fiat with Vault funds

## Add to your app

You can easily integrate Mooni into your web application and quickly enable your users to cash out their crypto.

This is useful for marketplace builders which want to increase conversion rate by allowing their users to withdraw the profit they make on the app.

The integration is easy as adding a button on any website which will open Mooni app.

### With iFrame

To include Mooni, just add an iframe element within your website code and link to the Mooni Send page.

This solution is quick and will be always up-to-date with the latest versions.

You can check an example of such integration in the file [host-examples/iframe-host/public/index.html](host-examples/iframe-host/public/index.html)

```html
