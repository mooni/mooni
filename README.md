# crypto-off-ramp

> This is experimental software under active development.

## Presentation

This web app allows to easily transfer money from your crypto wallet to your bank account. 

This is just a UI that connect different providers, we do not have any backend or smart contract. 

### Features
- Login with any web3-compatible wallet *(Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, ...)*
- Store your account information encrypted in IPFS (thanks to [3Box](https://3box.io))
- Pay with ETH or any ERC20 token (thanks to [DEX.AG](https://dex.ag))
- Send to your bank account in EUR/CHF (thanks to [Bity](https://bity.com))


*This project is in early stage and not all features are developed yet.*

### Use cases
- I am a end user and I want to withdraw some crypto on my bank account
- I am a dApp developer and I want to allow my users to withdraw funds to their bank account (such as decentralized marketplaces, via a widget or iFrame)
- I have a DAO (Aragon) and I want to be able to pay a bill in fiat with Vault funds
