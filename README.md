## Presentation

Mooni provides a simple solution for end-users, marketplaces or DAOs to cash out their crypto in fiat directly to a bank account.

### Features
- Login with any web3-compatible wallet *(Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, ...)*
- Store your account information encrypted in IPFS (thanks to [3Box](https://3box.io))
- Send to your bank account in EUR/CHF (thanks to [Bity](https://bity.com))


*This project is in early stage and shall be used with care.*

### Use cases
- I am a end user and I want to withdraw some crypto on my bank account
- I am a dApp developer and I want to allow my users to withdraw funds to their bank account (such as decentralized marketplaces, via a widget or iFrame)
- I have a DAO (Aragon) and I want to be able to pay a bill in fiat with Vault funds

## Add to your app

You can easily integrate Mooni into your web application and quickly enable your users to cash out their crypto.

This is useful for marketplace builders which want to increase conversion rate by allowing their users to withdraw the profit they make on the app.

`yarn add @mooni/widget`
