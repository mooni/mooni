# üåö Mooni Widget

[![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@mooni/widget)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mooni/widget)

Mooni widget allows to quickly add Mooni into any web app in minutes.

The widget can either appear as a modal on top of an app, or included inside an HTML element. 

If the hosting app already has a connected user with web3, this wallet can be forwarded to the widget.

## üéÅ Quick start
#### Install

`yarn add @mooni/widget`
 
#### Start widget

```javascript
// Import package
import MooniWidget from '@mooni/widget';

// Instanciate the widget
const mooni = new MooniWidget();

// Open the widget as a modal when you want it
mooni.open();
```

### üì∫ Example apps

An [example app](https://integration-example.mooni.tech) including Mooni widget have been published to let you try it out.

We also provided some [code examples](../example-host) that includes Mooni widget. You can also check the [Burner Wallet integration](../burner-plugin/src/ui/MooniPage.tsx) for a more advanced use case.

## üéõ Reference

#### Instanciation

- `new MooniWidget(opts)`  
Instanciate a Mooni widget.

`opts.containerElement`: Include Mooni inside of an HTML element on your website. If not set, the widget will appear as a modal.

`opts.ethereum`: A standard JSON-RPC provider. This is useful if the hosting app already authenticated the web3 wallet of the user, so he doesn't have to login again on Mooni.

`opts.token`: Automatically select a token to sell in Mooni.

#### If used as a modal:
- `mooni.open()`  
Opens the Mooni widget modal.


- `mooni.close()`  
Closes the Mooni widget modal. Not mandatory, a button is present to enable the user to close it.
